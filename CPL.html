  <h1>CPL General Handling and Stall recovery</h1>

  <h3>Piper Arrow 200</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>70 kts to rotate, Don't forget GFELT after every take off or touch and go. Negative runway Gear up, flap up, Engine temps and pressures are green, power back to 25” propeller 24”, landing lights off, trim for 90 kts, weave during climb and
      adjust manifold pressure. Freda Check.
    <li>Climbing turns are at 15 – 20 degrees bank angle. Base to final turn 20 degrees bank angle. Base and downwind turns 30 degrees bank angle.</li>
    <li>Power setting for 90 kts 16” 100 kts 18” 120 kts 22”.</li>
    <li>Gliding turns: Get best glide speed first, 80 kts for 30 degrees bank angle and 90 kts for 45 degrees bank angle. For a 360 degrees gliding turn. Start with 80 kts and 30 degrees bank angle initially. Increase it to 45 degrees bank angle at
      90 kts and 60 degrees before finishing the turn back to 30 degrees bank angle at 80 kts.</li>
    <li>Increase manifold pressure by 1” for a 100 fpm climb at the current speed. Example: For a climb at 90 kts at 300 fpm power setting should be 19” inches. For 500 fpm it is 21”. No need to trim for the climb if AC is already trimmed and flying
      straight and level at 90 kts all you need to do is increase power by 5” inches for 500 fpm and decrease power by 5” inches for a descent at 500 fpm.</li>
    <li>Before a stall recovery check “HASELL” Are you happy with the height? Airframe clean or flaps and gear down depending on the type of stall, Security (No loose objects that can harm us, door is locked, hatches and harnesses), Engine
      temperatures and pressures are green fuel pump on. Location: Free of clouds, build up areas, airspace, danger and restricted areas, turn for a look out.</li>
    <li>Stall at clean configuration: Bug the heading, power off, start pulling back to keep the altitude initially and pull all the way back until the nose drops. With nose drop apply full power and start pulling back to recover. The nose initially
      will be below the horizon and AC will pitch up afterwards with full power and pull back.</li>
    <li>Stall at final approach: Bug heading, power back to 12” inches, landing gear down (speed must be 129 kts) flaps down 3 stages (speed must be at white arc). Start pulling back until the stall warner! Push the control column forward gently and
      apply full power, get rid of the 3rd stage of flap asap to reduce drag, wait for positive rate gear up, positive rate flap up, positive rate flap up. Reduce power to 25” inches and climb to given altitude at 80 kts.</li>
    <li>Base to Final: Power back to 12” inches, landing gear down with 2 stages of flaps, start turning with 20 degrees bank angle and pull back until stall warner and push forward, full power, correct bank angle, wait for positive rate and landing
      gear up, positive rate, flap up, positive rate flap up, power back to 25” climb with 80 kts.</li>
  </ul>
