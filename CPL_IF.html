  <h1>CPL Instrument Flight</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Cruise flight at 120 kts, IF section of the exam starts with putting the screens up.</li>
    <li>As soon as the screens are up ask: PIMSTV: PITOT heat on, Is there any ICE?, I would descent to MSA, Turn SOUTH (around) 180 degrees, I would ask for TRAFFIC service and VECTOR.</li>
    <li>To slow down to 90 kts, reduce RPM to 13” and trim to keep altitude with back pressure on controls. Once speed reduces to 90 kts increase power to 16” and keep heading and altitude. Finish with TRIM.</li>
    <li>To increase speed back to 120 kts, increase RPM to 25” and start trimming to stay level, once speed reaches at 120kts, reduce RPM to 22”. Finish with TRIM and make sure heading stays the same at all times.</li>
    <li>If asked to turn to a given heading, BUG the heading first, make sure AC is straight and level, ask the examiner if it's clear to turn, watch AI for a rate 1 turn and keep VSI at 0. Keep Rate 1 VSI 0- Rate 1 VSI 0 constantly. Wings level
      reaching side of the bug.</li>
    <li>To recover from an unusual attitude with limited panel. Check the airspeed first and apply full power if speed is decreasing, cut the power if speed is increasing. Bank the AC to the opposite side until indicates a rate 1 turn and then wings
      level. Pitch up if altitude is decreasing, pitch down if it's increasing. Watch the altimeter and if it's
    <li>To make a turn to a given heading with limited panel: Make sure the AC is flying level, check the compass and turn the OBS knob until it shows current compass heading, cross check them. Start the turn and then the timer. Stop the turn
      reaching the calculated time for that turn. 10 seconds for every 30 degrees.</li>
    <li>To get a position fix. If you know more or less where you are, that means you know which VOR station is closest. If not, check the DME distance of two stations. Select the closer one to get a better signal. Current heading and altitude must
      be kept same at all times. After selecting the VOR station, identify
      it on NAV1, identify it on DME and while waiting for the DME ident morse code signal, press and hold on the VOR knob to get the radial (tail of the needle). Keep altitude and heading. Head down to mark the radial and draw a line with the ruler
      to mark the distance. Check heading and altitude in between.</li>
  </ul>
