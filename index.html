  <h3>Flight Training</h3>
  <p>
    Currently training at Stapleford Flight Center to obtain a commercial pilot's licence

    for my ATPL exams at Oxford Aviation Academy. Between 2015 - 2016 I've attended Flight Training London to
    obtain a private pilot's licence where I bulit good relationships with the ATO so much that they trust me with
    their delivery of aircraft from - to Leicester where they lease their aircraft from. This is how I completed
    most of my hour building.
